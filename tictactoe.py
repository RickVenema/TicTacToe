    # TicTacToe!
    
    TicTacToe! is a tictactoe game with 'fake' graphics.
    
    # HOW TO PLAY
    The program will draw a board for you. The first player (the game always start with player X) will be asked which slot he or she wants to fill.
    Each slot has a unique code:
    
    ----------------
    | t1 | t2 | t3 |
    ----------------
    | t4 | t5 | t6 |
    ----------------
    | t7 | t8 | t9 |
    ----------------
    
    
    So if you want to fill the slot in the upper right corner, you type 't3'. For the slot in the middle, you type 't5' etc.
    
    Have fun playing this game with your friends and feel free to improve this script!
